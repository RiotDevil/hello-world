# Markdown
i'm already loosely aware of what markdown is and how it works. if i recall correctly...
**bold** text is done with double asteriks (** **).
*italics* are done with single asteriks (* *), or with _underlines_ (_ _).
<ins>underlines</ins> are done with (<ins> </ins>). weirder to remember ig
~~strikethrough~~ is done with double tildas on each side (~~ ~~)
